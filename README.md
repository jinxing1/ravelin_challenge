# ravelin_challenge
Data scientist challenge from Ravelin Technology

/example : An analysis report (html file) 

/data.csv: The dataset

/data_pre_processing.R: A function which loads data from csv and pre-processes the raw data

/data_analysing.R : A R script which analyses the dataset, constructs models and generates a report (html file)

/forecasting.R A function which can forecast with a given date, given circumstance and given drivers_available

TO DO:
1. Run the script "data_pre_processing.R" to generate the report
2. Run the script "data_analysing.R" to load the forecasting function and see an example how to call the forecasting function. Once the forecasting funciton is loaded, we can call the function with customised input and it will return an output which is the number of orders.
