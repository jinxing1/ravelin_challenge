## Ravelin Code Test

Below is some data from a fictional transportation company. It details the number of orders that customers of this company make on any given day, with some additional variables. You should:

 * Provide exploratory analysis of the dataset.
 * Summarise and explain the key trends in the data, providing visualisations and tabular representations as necessary.
 * Construct a model or models to predict the number of orders that this transportation company will complete on any given day.
 * Explain what factors you think are significant and insignificant in contributing to the number of orders, and any other information about your model that you think is important.

 Please use either Python or R for this exercise - iPython notebooks are also acceptable. You can use whatever external software libraries you think are appropriate.
